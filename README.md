# Diversity and Inclusion

### Briefing
It’s omnipresent: telecom marketing. Better price here. Better service there. Best for small businesses here. Best for young urbanites there. But what do customers really want? Our client, a big telecom company needs to know. This email just arrived for me:

#### The task 🛠️

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Retention Manager is looking for an accurate overview of their customer churn.

#### My solution 👨🏻‍💻

After cleaning and modelling the data to a star schema, my solution was to create a dashboard that answered the KPIs, focusing on the following points:

🟢 Categorize the churned customers based on age, gender, and their dependents  
🟢 Count of customer churn with respect to multiple lines, technical support, internet support and online security  
🟢 Count of churn by tenure  
🟢 Segmenting payment methods, paperless billing and admin and technical tickets by the customers on churning  
🟢 Churn of customers on the basis of services they are subscribed to  

As part of my PwC Virtual Internship, I created a dashboard in Power BI for Janet, a Retention Manager from telecom, that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
